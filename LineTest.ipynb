    "A list comprehension in Python is a way to take a list of things—say, numbers, words, or in our case, lines of text in a text file—and manipulate that sequence. A list comprehension looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `[` *predicate-expression* `for` *temporary-variable-name* `in` *source-list* `if` *membership-expression* `]`\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a lot of weird stuff. Here's a rundown of the parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a *source list*, or the list whose values will be transformed or filtered;\n",
    "* a *predicate expression*, to be evaluated for every item in the list;\n",
    "* (optionally) a *membership expression* that determines whether or not an item in the source list will be included in the result of evaluating the list comprehension, based on whether the expression evaluates to True or False; and\n",
    "* a *temporary variable name* by which each value from the source list will be known in the predicate expression and membership expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put all that on the back burner for a second. For the most part, in the rest of this notebook, you won't be writing list comprehensions from scratch---you'll be making tweaks to list comprehensions I've already written for you. But having an idea about how they're put together will help you reason about which parts you can change and how you can change them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list comprehension in the next cell uses a *plain text file* as the source list. The *temporary variable name* is `line` and the *predicate expression* simply removes white space (like space characters, tabs, and newline characters) from the end of the line.
